I had issues displaying the plotly plots in the exported html document some sites i sought the answer said to attach some script 
at the head of the html document which I did. 
the script I added are;
>`<head><script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"> </script></head>` 
   and 
>`<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.3.5/require.min.js"></script>`
